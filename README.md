Compilation of the final code written for our MPhys project on simulating two photon absorption in a silicon carbide diode. The energy scan file contains code writted by Miranda van Heel, and the depth scan file contains code written by Celyn Sammons. 

The energy scan (depth scan) file contains code for simulating an energy scan (depth scan) and comparing results to experimental data collected using two different amplifiers. Please bear in mind that this code was written for personal use and designed to be interpreted alongside lab notes, and may not be easy to interpret without.
